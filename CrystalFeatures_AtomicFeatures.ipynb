Have a look at the database here: https://materialsproject.org. Check the statistics at the bottom of the page. There are 124,000 inorganic crystals in the database, along with the DFT-calculated properties of these materials. There are also 530,000 nanoporous materials, as well as other stuff. It's a huge amount of material data.\n","\n","### Signing up and the API key\n","\n","You will need to **sign up** in materialsproject.org to be able to access the database. Signing up there is free.\n","\n","Once you sign up, you can obtain an **API key** that will enable you to access the database using python. Will discuss this further shortly.\n","\n","### A look at MaterialsProject\n","\n","Let's have a look at the 124,000 inorganic crystals data. Each one of these crystals is a 3D crystal that includes: a number of elements, arranged in a lattice structure. Check, for example, the MP page for diamond: https://materialsproject.org/materials/mp-66/.\n","\n","![MP page for diamond](https://sheriftawfikabbas.github.io/images/MP_diamond.png)\n","\n","Note that each material on MP is identified by an ID that goes like `mp-X` where `X` is a number. The ID of diamond is `mp-66`. People use these identifiers when referring to MP materials in papers, and we will use them soon when we start querying materials from MP using python.\n","\n","There you will find the crystal structure, the lattice parameters, the basic properties (in a column to the right of the figure that displays the crystal), and then a range of DFT-calculated properties.\n","\n","### The DFT properties\n","\n","These are quantities that are calculated for each crystal in MP. In fact, every thing you see on the MP page for diamond was calculated using DFT. \n","\n","- For a given elemental composition, the lattice parameters and the positions of the atoms within the lattice are all obtained using DFT.\n","- For the obtained crystal structure, the `Final Magnetic Moment`, `Formation Energy / Atom`, `Energy Above Hull / Atom`, `Band Gap` are calculated. The `Density` is derived from the obtained crystal structure.\n","- Further DFT calculations are performed to obtain the band structure as well as other properties that you can find as you scroll down the structure page on MP.\n","\n","Some of the crystals on MP correspond to crystals that exist in nature, and some are purely hypothetical. The hypothetical crystals have been generated by some algorithm that uses artificial intelligence, or probably by simple elemental substitution.\n","\n","### Why is MP great for machine learning?\n","\n","Because of the huge amount of materials (dataset) and DFT-calculated properties (target properties). That much data can be utilised using a range of machine learning methods to make predictions with various levels of accuracy.\n","\n","## The PyMatGen python library\n","\n","To be able to query the MP database, the MP team provided the community with a python library that you can install on your computer (or in Colab as I will show you).\n","\n","Remember: to be able to run the codes in this section, you must obtain an API key from the MP website: https://materialsproject.org/docs/api#API_keys.\n","\n","The first thing we do here is to install PyMatGen in Colab.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"BzU4U1vn-QL4","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1632071526111,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":71556,"user":{"displayName":"Gildardo

By crystal, I mean a structure that is endowed with **periodicity**. Let’s take the example of **diamond**. This material has just one atom, carbon (C). If you could zoom-in very close into diamond such that you can see the C atoms (people sort of do that using advanced experimental techniques by the way), you will see something similar to the following figure.\n","\n","![Left: the diamond unit cell. Right: infinitely repeating the unit cell in the three directions gives us the diamond crystal.](https://sheriftawfikabbas.github.io/images/diamond.png)\n","\n","The figure illustrates how a diamond crystal is created from the **diamond unit cell**, which is the little molecule on the left with 4 C atoms. The crystal has **infinitely many diamond unit cells* along the three directions, so it is a 3D pattern.\n","\n","Before we discuss crystals further, consider molecules for a minute. Molecules are **fundamentally different** from crystals because of the pattern (periodicity) bit: a molecule is just that one single molecule, sitting on its own, in isolation, whereas a crystal is really composed of an infinite number of molecules. How would the pattern in the crystal make ML for molecules different from ML for crystals?\n","\n","To predict the properties of the molecules one can derive a set of descriptors for the molecules in the data set that are based on the **positions of the atoms within the molecule**. One can derive descriptors based on the relative positions, in order to ensure that the descriptors are **invariant to transformations**: rotation and translation.\n","\n","The key thing here in the molecular descriptors is that they are **based on the atomic positions**. In crystals, **we can't really use atomic positions** like we did with molecules to obtain descriptors. Why?\n","\n","Think about the diamond crystal pattern above. Because it is a pattern, it is **symmetric in all three directions**. Now let's say we are going to calculate the Coulomb matrix for diamond, so we start with the positions of the atoms in the unit cell of diamond, that figure on the left. But wait: even though these four atoms do form a valid unit cell for diamond, we can also come up with another valid unit cell, as shown below.\n","\n","![Another possible structure for the diamond unit cell.](https://sheriftawfikabbas.github.io/images/diamon_alternative_unit_cell.png)\n","\n","The figure above is also valid. How to obtain it? Look at the diamond crystal in Figure 1, and take a different repeating unit from it. As long as this repeating unit can also form the same pattern, it is a valid unit cell!\n","\n","So, there are many different ways we can represent the unit cell of a crystal. Therefore, we cannot use the atomic coordinates to derive descriptors for crystals, otherwise the derived descriptors, such as the eigenvalues of the Coulomb matrix in the case of molecules, will **change dramatically for the same crystal**. That is, **the descriptor vector is not invariant with respect to translation of the unit cell**. What do we do then?\n","\n","## Building a simple descriptor vector for crystals\n","\n","A possible solution to this problem is to use some statistics of atomic properties as the descriptor vector. For example:\n","\n","- Average of the atomic numbers of all the elements in the crystal. For example, in silicon carbide, SiC, the average value would be the average of 14 (for Si) and 6 (for C), which is (14 + 6)/2 = 10. So that's now one number in the descriptor vector.\n","- The average of the ionization potential of the atoms\n","- The average of the electron affinity of the atoms\n","- And more averages\n","\n","So we can keep adding averages of properties to this list, to expand the descriptor vector. This vector will not suffer from the lack of invariance issue pointed out above, because these are average values of quantities that do not depend on the geometry of the crystal.\n","\n","Average is just one statistic. We can also add other statistics, such as the standard deviation and the variance. Adding those will triple the number elements in the descriptor vector above.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"njZ80LkJcNgd","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1623116111920,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Sherif Tawfik","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pkq2qTyEGvM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFoA/jDXaFewCL-s/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"08424006537682359657"}},"outputId":"9ee85d02-e64a-4650-88d4-2b80bdd01745"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","structure = structure[0]\n","mean_atomic_number=np.mean(structure.atomic_numbers)\n","max_atomic_number=np.max(structure.atomic_numbers)\n","min_atomic_number=np.min(structure.atomic_numbers)\n","std_atomic_number=np.std(structure.atomic_numbers)\n","\n","print(mean_atomic_number,max_atomic_number,min_atomic_number,std_atomic_number)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["11.36 32 3 7.509354166637767\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SlwQwH9ZcUpJ"},"source":["However, there is a **problem**.
